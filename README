This tool obtains  the effective pom of the current project, reads its dependencies and generates build.gradle scripts. It also generates settings.gradle for multimodule builds.
It currently supports both single-module and multi-module POMs, inheritance, dependency management, properties - everything.

Usage:
Run Maven2Gradle main class. Parameters:
* -verbose prints the obtained effective pom
* -keepFile saves the obtained effective pom

Note: Your project will be considered multi-module only if your reactor is also a parent of at least one of your modules. Why so? Reactor project is built last, when Parent project is built first. I need reactor to be built first, because effective-pom Mojo generates needed output only if it founds modules in first project it encounters. Making reactor also a parent achieves this.
